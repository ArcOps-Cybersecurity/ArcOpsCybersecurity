<h2 align="center">Security Philosophy</h2>

Security is not a checkbox. It is an engineering responsibility.

Our work is guided by:
- Security-by-design from the start
- Least-privilege access as a default
- Defense-in-depth over single-point controls
- Transparency, accountability, and restraint
- Practical, maintainable security controls
